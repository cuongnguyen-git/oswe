# Clean Snippet Builder

A lightweight, interactive command-line tool that helps you quickly browse, select, and copy useful Python code snippets to your clipboard.

Perfect for developers who frequently need ready-to-use patterns for Flask apps, requests sessions, file handling, CLI argument parsing, and more — without searching docs or old projects every time.

*(Add a real terminal recording / screenshot later using e.g. `asciinema` or Kap for macOS)*

## ✨ Features

- Clean, neutral, general-purpose Python snippets only (no exploits / security payloads)
- Nested, numbered menu navigation
- Copy selected snippet directly to clipboard (requires `pyperclip`)
- Categories include:
  - Command-line argument parsing (`argparse`)
  - Flask basics, templates, static files
  - File uploads & downloads (secure practices)
  - HTTP clients with retries & progress bars
  - Small static file servers
  - Directory walking, pandas chunk reading, thread pools, etc.
- Easy to extend — just add entries to the `SNIPPETS` dictionary
- KeyboardInterrupt friendly (Ctrl+C exits gracefully)
