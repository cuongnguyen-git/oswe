# README

When studying for the oswe, I found it difficult to create a full python script because I am not sufficient with python. I used AI to assist me with a builder. For example, the program can output a flask app, basic parsing arguments, setting up static files in flask (like a reverse shell). 

This made it easier for me to just automate my scripting and focus on the vulnerablities. 

The script is not complete. I had a lot of code snippets that I did not add to this as it was a last minute thing that came to my mind to do.
